# polymorphvehicles
An example repo which I use in a workshop context to teach Spring and dive into polymorphism using Jackson and Hibernate.

The presentation I'm using for this workshop can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18wDpgFFrKWzz5JQ8RjS5M5HcEMEp0i_UwU8VZ02fz10/edit?usp=sharing

Please have a look at the feature branches in this project to check out the different subject that are discussed during the workshop.
